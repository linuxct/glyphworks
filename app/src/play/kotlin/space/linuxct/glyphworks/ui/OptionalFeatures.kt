/**
 * The `play` flavour's half of the optional-feature seam: nothing, on purpose.
 *
 * The Google Play build ships **without the design assistant and without the
 * update checker**, and not by disabling them — `src/github` holds `ai/`,
 * `core/ai/` and `update/`, and this source set does not, so none of that code
 * reaches the APK. That absence is what lets the Play listing declare no data
 * collected and no data shared, and it is checkable from the binary rather than
 * taken on trust:
 *
 * ```
 * aapt2 dump permissions app-play-release.apk | grep -c INTERNET   # 0
 * unzip -p … classes.dex | strings | grep -ciE 'openai|chatgpt'    # 0
 * ```
 *
 * Every declaration below mirrors one in `src/github/.../OptionalFeatures.kt`.
 * The signatures must stay identical; nothing checks that but a build of the
 * other flavour, which is why CI builds both.
 *
 * **Empty bodies rather than a missing call site.** `main` calls these
 * unconditionally, so the Play build is the same code path with the feature
 * absent, rather than a second layout that could drift from the one people use.
