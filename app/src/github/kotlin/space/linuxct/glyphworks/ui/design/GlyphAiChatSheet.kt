/**
 * The conversation about one design: the assistant, full screen.
 *
 * ## Why full screen, when every other pop-up here is a card
 *
 * A card is the right shape for a question with two answers. This is a thread
 * that scrolls, a keyboard, an image picker and a reply arriving a word at a
 * time — on a phone that is a screen's worth of content, and a 320 dp card would
 * spend most of its height on the editor showing through behind it. It is still
 * a [MotionDialog], on the same springs as everything else, with `fullScreen`
 * asking for the window to be measured against the display rather than against
 * `config_prefDialogWidth` — and, with it, for the window to stop fitting system
 * windows so that the keyboard arrives here as an inset instead of as a resize.
 * The [safeDrawingPadding] below is then the only thing accounting for the IME;
 * see `MotionDialog`'s `fullScreen` for what a second accounting looked like.
 *
 * It is a dialog and not an Activity for the reason `GlyphAiConsentDialog` gives:
 * pushing an activity would tear down the editor beneath it — flushing a save,
 * dropping the live matrix preview, reloading the design on the way back — and
 * the assistant's whole job is to change the canvas that is on screen *now*.
 *
 * ## Nothing durable lives here
 *
 * The transcript, the turn in flight, the attachments and the undo snapshot are
 * all in the activity-scoped `GlyphAiViewModel`. This function holds two pieces
 * of throwaway UI state, both in a `rememberSaveable`: the half-typed message,
 * and whether the reset confirmation is up. So rotating the phone while
 * the model is answering keeps the answer arriving, keeps the attached photos and
 * keeps the sentence being typed — and closing the modal mid-turn does not
 * cancel it either, which matters because the turn may be *applying a design*.
 *
 * ## Monochrome
 *
 * No new hues, as everywhere else in this app: the user's turn is
 * `surfaceVariant`, the assistant's is the page, the trace and the tool notes are
 * `onSurfaceVariant`, and the only other colour is the theme's `error` on a
 * failure. The distinction that carries the meaning is alignment and weight, not
 * hue.

 * longest string in this screen — competing with two words of chrome on either
 * side at every font scale. This app already has the answer for a row with more
 * than one action on it: the design list's card uses [Icons.Outlined.MoreVert] and
 * a [DropdownMenu], and both of the items below are things somebody does rarely
 * and on purpose. So the row keeps one icon, and the title keeps the width.
 *
 * Reset comes first because it is about *this* conversation, which is what the
 * screen is; signing out is about the account behind every conversation.
 * [canReset] greys the first one out rather than hiding it, so the action does

/**
 * Where the end of the thread is, **as the list last measured it**, plus

 *
 * ## What was wrong with `animateScrollToItem(last)`
 *
 * That call aligns the item's *top* with the top of the viewport. For a short
 * bubble the difference never shows, but the live block of a tool turn is one
 * item — heading, a step list that grows a line at a time, the status row and the
 * elapsed clock — and once it is taller than what is left of the screen, putting
 * its top at the top leaves its bottom under the composer. That is the half-cut
 * "Reading what came back… 0:50" the screenshot caught, and why dragging the list
 * a few pixels fixed it: the user was finishing a scroll that had stopped early.
 *
 * ## Asking for a position past the end, and letting the list clamp
 *
 * The `scrollOffset` argument moves the target *up* by that many pixels, so a
 * request larger than what remains is a request to scroll beyond the end of the
 * content — which `LazyListState` resolves by landing exactly on the end,
 * including the bottom `contentPadding` that accounts for the pinned composer.
 * So the last line ends up clear of the bottom bar whether the last item is a
 * tall live block or a one-line message, and it can never over-scroll into blank
 * space: past the end simply *is* the end.
 *
 * ## Why one viewport and not [PAST_THE_END]
 *
 * The streaming effect snaps, so it can hand `scrollToItem` an absurd offset and
 * pay nothing for it. The animated one is given the distance as its target: with
 * 100,000 px the spring crosses the whole screen inside the first frame and the
 * "animation" becomes a jump. One viewport is the smallest request that is always
 * past the end — nothing follows the last item but the list's own padding — and
 * it springs across a screen the way every other motion in this app does.
 *
 * ## THE BUG THIS TYPE EXISTS FOR: `layoutInfo` is a measurement, not a plan
 *
 * All of the above was already true and the list still stopped one item short,
 * because the numbers it was given were the *previous* frame's. `layoutInfo` is
 * written by the measure pass, and a `LaunchedEffect` keyed on the conversation
 * runs as soon as that conversation changes — before the new step row has been
 * measured, and often before it has been composed. So `totalItemsCount - 1` named
 * the item *before* the new one, the scroll landed one row high, and the live
 * status line stayed under the composer until the user dragged it. Reading
 * `viewportSize` from the same stale snapshot has the same flaw.
 *
 * The fix is to stop treating an event as the trigger and let the **layout** be
 * the trigger. Both effects build this record inside a `snapshotFlow`, which
 * re-runs its block whenever any state it read is invalidated and emits only when
 * the result differs from the last one it emitted. `LazyListState.layoutInfo` is
 * a `mutableStateOf(…, neverEqualPolicy())` assigned at the end of every measure,
 * so every measure invalidates the block and the block always re-reads the
 * newest measurement. A stale count therefore cannot be the *last* thing the flow
 * says: appending an item forces a measure, the measure forces an emission, and
 * that emission carries the count the list actually has. [lastIndex] and
 * [viewportHeight] come out of one `layoutInfo` read, so they are two facts about
 * one measurement rather than two reads that might straddle a frame.
 *
 * The conversation's own counters stay in the record because they are what should
 * *provoke* a scroll — a trace line changing without changing the item count still
 * moves the last row. Their emission may carry a not-yet-remeasured count, and
 * that is harmless: the measure that follows emits again, `collectLatest` cancels
 * the half-finished animation and retargets, and the final target is always the
 * measured one. That is also what makes a burst of step rows behave — every row
 * retargets the same spring instead of queueing an animation behind it.
 *
 * Only the fields below are extracted from `layoutInfo`, and neither of them
 * changes while a scroll is running (scrolling moves offsets, not the item count
 * or the viewport). So the animation cannot feed itself a new emission and
 * restart forever.
