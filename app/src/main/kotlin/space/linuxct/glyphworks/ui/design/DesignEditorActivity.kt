/**
 * The pixel editor: one Glyph Matrix, drawn on with a finger, one frame at a time.
 *
 * ## Nothing here is ever lost
 *
 * A drawing is somebody's work and this app has no "discard changes?" dialog, so
 * the guarantee is structural rather than a question:
 *
 * 1. **Every completed gesture schedules a save.** A stroke, a tap, an undo, a
 *    redo, a clear, a fill, a duration change, a frame added / duplicated /
 *    deleted / reordered and a variant switch each mark the design dirty and arm
 *    [SaveScheduler]. The write lands [SAVE_DEBOUNCE_MS] after the last of them.
 * 2. **Leaving writes immediately.** Back, up, the save action and `ON_STOP`
 *    (home, recents, a task switch) *flush* — they cancel the pending timer and
 *    write there and then, synchronously with respect to `finish()`. No leave
 *    path can be reached without the file being written first.
 * 3. **Back does not race the save.** `finish()` runs *after* the write
 *    completes, from inside the same coroutine, so the activity — and with it
 *    the composition scope the write is running in — cannot be torn down
 *    mid-write. A save that FAILS does not close the editor at all: the drawing
 *    stays on screen where it can be tried again, which is the only honest
 *    response to a file that would not write.
 * 4. **The write itself is atomic** (`DesignStore` writes a temp file and then
 *    renames), so even a battery pull leaves either the previous design or the
 *    new one — never half of each.
 *
 * The one window this leaves open is a *foreground* process death inside the
 * debounce interval, which on Android means a crash — and a crash loses the
 * unsaved gesture, not the design. See [SAVE_DEBOUNCE_MS] for why that trade is
 * the right one now that a file can be a hundred and fifty kilobytes.
 *
 * A write that lands also tells the matrix to re-read (`refreshCurrentScreen`),
 * because the `Custom` toy loads the design file in `onActivate` and would
 * otherwise go on showing the pre-edit drawing after the editor closed. See that
 * method for the lifecycle ordering, and [SaveOutcome] for why only a write that
 * genuinely happened is allowed to trigger it.
 *
 * Saving goes through [saveRespectingAuthor], which pins `author` back to
 * whatever is already on disk: opening somebody else's imported design and
 * touching it up must not quietly put this phone's creator name on their work.
 * `createdAt` is never touched, and `modifiedAt` is restamped on every save.
 *
 * ## What this phase edits
 *
 * **The selected frame of the selected variant.** Every tool — the brush, undo,
 * redo, clear and fill — acts on whichever frame the timeline has selected, and
 * the undo history is *per frame* (see [TimelineEntry]) so undoing after moving
 * along the timeline can never rewrite a frame the user is no longer looking at.
 * A static design has one frame and no timeline; a dynamic one gets the timeline,
 * per-frame durations, onion skin, loop and key mode.
 *
 * ## What is on the surface, and what is not
 *
 * The canvas is `weight(1f)`: it gets exactly the height the controls leave, and
 * at 13x13 the cell pitch is a straight linear function of that height. So the
 * screen is rationed by **how often a control is touched** — palette, tools and
 * timeline stay, while loop, key mode and the variant explanation live behind the
 * app bar in [DesignSettings]. See that function for the measurements behind the
 * split.
 *
 * The variant switcher is rationed by whether it can do anything at all: it is on
 * the surface only for a design that actually carries more than one size, which
 * is derived from the design's own variants and never from a stored field. The
 * new-design dialog chooses what to seed; [DesignSettings] carries the way to add
 * the other size later.
 *
 * ## Live preview
 *
 * While this activity is resumed the real Glyph Matrix mirrors this design, with
 * hard precedence over the selected toy and over every compositing override — the
 * frame being drawn, or the animation running, depending on the app bar's
 * play/pause. See [LiveMatrixPreview] for what each of those shows and costs, and
 * `ScreenManager.beginLivePreview` for how precedence is actually enforced.
 * Opening a design also makes it the design the `Custom` toy plays, silently, so
 * that closing the editor leaves the drawing on the panel rather than whatever was
 * there before.
 *
 * ## Performance
 *
 * See [EditorFrame] for the phase discipline that keeps a moving finger out of
 * recomposition, and [ThumbnailCache] for the one that keeps the timeline out of
 * it.
 *
 * **What redraws on a clock, and what does not.** This screen used to promise
 * none of it. It now has exactly two clocks and each one is bounded by something
 * the user did:
 *
 * 1. **The floating preview's frame loop** ([FloatingLivePreview]) — running only
 *    while the design is dynamic, has more than one frame, the widget is composed
 *    and the activity is resumed. A tick writes one Int that is read from a draw
 *    lambda, so it invalidates one node's draw and recomposes nothing.
 * 2. **Playback on the panel**, while play is switched on: a `delay` chain at the
 *    design's own frame rate, not a frame callback, and it stops with the toggle
 *    or with the activity.
 *
 * Everything else is unchanged and still holds: the reorder drag's frame loop dies
 * with the finger (see `DesignTimeline`), and the paused live preview is a
 * `snapshotFlow` that suspends unless a pixel changed. **An idle editor showing a
 * static design still issues no frames and no pushes at all**, and an idle one
 * showing an animation issues frames for one small disc and nothing else.
 * [requestPeakRefreshRateWhileVisible] is called for the same reason every other
 * visible activity calls it — so a drag is sampled and presented at 120 Hz instead
 * of at whatever the display policy would otherwise park us on.

/**
 * How long the editor waits, after the last change, before writing the file.

 * was one 169-cell frame. A 240-frame arbok design is ~150 kB of cell characters,
 * and re-encoding and re-writing all of it after every stroke of a drawing
 * session is exactly the battery cost the editor was told not to have.
 *
 * 750 ms is chosen against the two things it sits between:
 *
 * - **Longer than a drawing burst's rhythm.** Lifting a finger, repositioning and
 *   putting it down again is a few hundred milliseconds, so a run of strokes
 *   collapses into one write instead of one write per stroke — which is the whole
 *   saving.
 * - **Shorter than "I've stopped drawing".** Someone who pauses to look at what
 *   they have made has the file on disk before they have finished looking.
 *
 * It never weakens the guarantee, because every way *out* of the editor flushes
 * first — see this file's KDoc, point (2). The debounce only ever delays a write
 * that nothing is yet waiting on.

/**

 *
 * 1. **Nothing is written.** The save scheduler's action becomes a no-op, so
 *    `DesignStore` is never asked to save, `refreshCurrentScreen` is never
 *    posted, and [store] is not touched at all.
 * 2. **Nothing takes the matrix.** [LiveMatrixPreview] is not composed, so no
 *    preview lease, no `setPreviewActive`, no `beginLivePreview` — the panel goes
 *    on showing whatever toy the user left on it.
 *
 * It buys nothing else, and that is the constraint it was written under: the tour
 * is worth having only if it demonstrates *this* editor, so anything the flag
 * changed beyond keeping its hands to itself would be the tour teaching a screen
 * that does not exist. Every control, gesture, animation and piece of state below
 * is the same one the real editor runs.
 *
 * See `ui/design/DesignDemo.kt` for the rest of the sandbox — the design with no
 * id, and the layer that stops the user reaching any of this.

/**
 * The design-level settings: loop, what the Essential Key does, what the two
 * variants actually are — and the way to acquire the second one.
 *
 * **Why these are behind a dialog and the palette is not.** The editor has one
 * scarce resource and it is vertical space: the canvas takes what the controls
 * leave, and at 13x13 the cell pitch is a linear function of it. Phase 6 put
 * loop and key mode permanently on the surface and the pitch fell into the
 * mid-teens — 4 mm or so against a fingertip contact patch of 8-10 mm, which
 * makes a *drawing* tool miss the cell you are looking at. Moving these two
 * rows and the variant sentence off the surface puts it back above 22 dp.
 *
 * The controls in here are touched a handful of times in a design's life; the
 * canvas is touched thousands. Rationing the surface by how often something is
 * used is the only ordering that does not pay a constant cost for an occasional
 * convenience — and a design-level dialog is where the rest of the design's
 * metadata (name, author, export) naturally belongs later.
 *
 * [MotionDialog] rather than a bare `Dialog` for the same reason every other
 * pop-up in this app uses it — it enters and leaves on the theme's springs
 * instead of appearing.
 *
 * ## "Add ... artwork", and why there is no "remove"
 *
 * A design created for one phone shows no variant switcher, so this dialog is
 * where the other size is reachable from. It belongs here rather than anywhere
 * else because this is already the place that explains the dual-size rule — the
 * action sits directly under the sentence that motivates it — and because it is a
 * design-level decision, which is what everything else in here is.
 *
 * **The reverse deliberately does not exist**, and the two are not symmetric.
 * Adding a variant creates an empty canvas: one map entry, no artwork touched,
 * and ignoring it costs nothing but the switcher staying on screen. Removing one
 * would delete frames somebody drew by hand, with no undo and possibly no other
 * copy. This app has exactly one destructive action — deleting a whole design —
 * and it is guarded by a confirmation that names the design; an unguarded second
 * one, two taps inside a dialog people open to toggle repeat, is a different
 * class of risk for a much smaller prize. The worst an unwanted variant does is
 * leave a 48 dp row on screen, and somebody who genuinely wants a single-size
 * file can create one. Nobody can un-delete art.

 * capped at all, so it grew to fill the sheet — 363 dp against the real 320 on

/**
 * The shortest gap between two pushes to the hardware, in milliseconds.

 * `GlyphLink`'s threading KDoc), issued with `flags=0` through an AIDL we do not
 * control. Pointer samples arrive at the input rate — 120 Hz on this display,
 * and a paint drag produces one per sample — so pushing per event would be four
 * times this rate of blocking IPC for a panel that cannot show the difference.
 *
 * `ScreenManager` already drops byte-identical frames, and that is deliberately
 * NOT what is relied on here: its dedup saves the *transaction* only once the
 * frame has already been built and handed over, and the traffic being coalesced
 * is mostly frames that genuinely differ (a stroke changes a cell per sample).

/**
 * Mirrors the design onto the real Glyph Matrix, with hard precedence over
 * everything else on it: the frame being edited while [playing] is false, and the
 * animation itself while it is true.
 *
 * ## Paused — the resting state, and the default
 *
 * **The frame being edited.** The preview exists to answer one question, "what
 * does this pixel actually look like on the hardware", and an animation playing
 * through is the one thing that cannot answer it: the pixel under the finger
 * would be on screen for a fraction of a second in every cycle, greys would be
 * impossible to judge against their neighbours, and the panel would be busiest
 * exactly when the user is trying to look at it. That is why playback is a
 * deliberate action and not what an opened editor does on its own.
 *
 * ## Playing
 *
 * The whole animation, frame by frame, honouring each frame's `durationMs` and
 * the design's repeat rule — [nextPlaybackFrame], [playbackHoldMs] and
 * [designRepeats] are the schedule, shared with the floating preview so the two
 * cannot disagree about the timing, and matching `CustomScreen.advance` so what
 * plays here is what the toy will play.
 *
 * A design that does not repeat plays through, holds its last frame for that
 * frame's own duration, and then **turns playback off**: [onRest] flips the
 * toggle, which puts the icon back to "play" and hands the panel to the paused
 * pump above — so the panel ends up showing the frame being edited, which is what
 * "paused" means everywhere else in this editor. Leaving the animation's final
 * frame up instead would be a third state, indistinguishable on the panel from a
 * playback that had got stuck.
 *
 * **Painting does not pause it, deliberately.** A stroke is not a request to stop
 * watching, and stopping on one would make the toggle fight the finger — press
 * play, touch the canvas, playback is over. It costs nothing in freshness either:
 * the cells are copied at *push* time, one frame at a time, so an edit to any
 * frame is on the panel the next time the loop reaches it, which for a design
 * anybody is drawing is well under a second. What the canvas shows is unchanged
 * in both states: the frame being edited.
 *
 * ## Cost while playing
 *
 * One `delay` chain, no frame callbacks, and one push per frame at the design's
 * own rate — floored at [PREVIEW_INTERVAL_MS], because a 20 ms frame is legal and
 * 50 blocking binder round-trips a second is not something to do for a panel that
 * cannot show the difference. It exists only while [playing] **and** the activity
 * is resumed: the effect is keyed on both, so leaving the editor for any reason
 * cancels it, and returning finds it paused only if the toggle was turned off.
 *
 * ## The other variant
 *
 * Only the variant matching this device's own panel can be previewed: a 25x25
 * arbok frame is not a thing a 13x13 bellsprout can show, and half of one is
 * worse than none. Switching to the other geometry therefore *releases* the
 * matrix — the gate opens, the toy comes back, the lease is dropped — and
 * switching back takes it again.
 *
 * ## Cost when nothing is happening
 *
 * Zero, while paused. The pump is a `snapshotFlow` over the frame's revision
 * counter, so it is suspended unless a pixel actually changed. No frame loop, no
 * polling; an idle *paused* editor issues no pushes and holds no timers. Reading
 * the revision from a `snapshotFlow` also keeps Phase 5's phase discipline
 * intact: the flow installs its own snapshot observer, so a moving finger
 * notifies this coroutine and the `Canvas` draw scopes, and recomposes nothing.

 * standard separation between a surface and the controls beneath it, and it is
 * the smallest value at which the palette clearly belongs to the toolbar below
 * rather than to the picture above.
 *
 * **It costs no cell pitch on any window this app runs on.** The panel's radius
 * is `ZOOM_TARGET * min(canvasWidth, canvasHeight)`, and the canvas is
 * width-capped on a phone in portrait — around 448 dp wide against 600-750 dp of
 * canvas height even with the timeline present — so the height this takes comes
 * out of slack that `min` was never going to look at. The pitch stays at 20.3 dp
 * at 13x13 and 10.5 dp at 25x25, exactly as [MAX_CANVAS_SCALE]'s table states.
 * The regime where it would cost something is the one that table's second half
 * describes (a large font scale, three-button navigation, a short window), and
 * there it is 16 x 0.045 = 0.72 dp at 13x13 and 0.38 dp at 25x25 — under a
 * twentieth of a cell, against a control row that could not otherwise be told
 * apart from the artwork.

 * through a camera zoomed until the panel fills a chosen fraction of the drawing

 * puts it at 42 dp, which is a comfortable target with room to see the cell under

 * and the pan clamp does all the work, so there is nothing to buy.
 *
 * **The table is the width-capped case, which is the good one.** `min(width,

 * wide, the numbers above are what the panel gets and no row below the canvas can
 * change them. Height only binds when the controls have eaten enough of it — a

 * The zoom and pan the user has applied over the disc, and the clamps that make

 *
 * ## Why this is snapshot state and where it may be read
 *
 * A pinch produces a value per pointer sample — 120 a second on this display —
 * exactly like a paint drag, so it is under exactly the same phase discipline
 * (see [EditorFrame]): the transform must cause a **redraw, not a
 * recomposition**. [scale], [offsetX] and [offsetY] are therefore read from the
 * `Canvas` draw lambda and from the pointer-input coroutine, and from nowhere
 * else. Reading them in a composable body would put the whole editor — palette,
 * tool row, timeline, app bar — through recomposition on every sample of a
 * gesture that changed nothing but where the disc is drawn.
 *
 * The one composable that has to care whether we are zoomed at all is the reset
 * control, and it goes through a `derivedStateOf` so it recomposes when the 1x
 * boundary is crossed rather than when the scale changes; see [ToolRow].
 *
 * ## The transform itself
 *
 * A uniform scale about the canvas origin plus a translation: `p -> p * scale +
 * offset`. Nothing more expressive is wanted — [MatrixDisc.transformedBy]
 * explains why keeping it to a similarity transform is what lets `matrixCellAt`
 * stay an exact inverse under it.

/**
 * The drawing surface: one Glyph Matrix, one finger painting on it and two

 *
 * ## One pointer stream, two meanings
 *
 * Painting and pinching share a pointer stream and will fight if they are handled
 * separately — a `detectDragGestures` and a `detectTransformGestures` in
 * neighbouring `pointerInput`s both see every event, neither knows what the other
 * decided, and the result is a stroke smeared across the canvas while it zooms.
 * So there is exactly ONE gesture loop, it counts pressed pointers itself, and
 * the meaning of a gesture is decided once and never revisited:
 *
 * - **Nothing is painted on the down.** A gesture is a paint only once the finger
 *   has committed to being one finger drawing: it has moved past the touch slop
 *   (a drag) or it has lifted (a tap). Two fingers never land at the same
 *   instant, and the earlier one always jitters slightly before the later one
 *   arrives, so painting on the down would put a cell down at the start of every
 *   single pinch. This is what "a pinch must never paint a cell" costs, and it
 *   costs nothing visible: a drag still paints from the down position, one frame
 *   later, and a tap paints on release.
 * - **A second finger ends the stroke.** Not cancels it — *ends* it. Everything
 *   painted up to that instant stays, and it stays as ONE undo step, because the
 *   pre-stroke snapshot was pushed on the first cell the stroke actually changed
 *   (see [EditorState.paint]) and is still exactly one entry. The alternative,
 *   letting the stroke run while the canvas moves under it, paints a line the
 *   user never drew.
 * - **It does not come back.** Once a gesture has had two fingers on it, lifting
 *   one leaves a gesture that transforms and nothing more, until every finger is
 *   off the glass. Resuming the stroke from wherever the surviving finger happens
 *   to be is a line nobody asked for.
 *
 * ## Where the zoom is read
 *
 * In the draw lambda and in the pointer coroutine, both of which are outside
 * composition — see [CanvasTransform] and [EditorFrame]. A pinch invalidates this
 * one draw scope and recomposes nothing.

 * that painted a literal 2048 regardless would write cells the file does not
 * describe. Three is what the default palette offers and what fits here; a longer
 * palette shows its first three until a later phase gives it a proper picker.
 *
 * Each swatch is a scale model of what it paints: a white dot at that level's own
 * alpha, on the panel's own black. That is why the glass and the LED have no
 * theme colour in them — see `GlyphCanvas` for why the panel is deliberately
 * theme-independent.
 *
 * ## Why the swatch is built differently on a light page
 *
 * The selection ring is `colorScheme.onSurface` and always has been, which is
 * near-white in dark mode and near-black in light. Drawn where it used to be —
 * inside the rim of a glass-black disc — that made it a **near-black ring on a
 * near-black disc**: 1.03:1, invisible, so in light mode there was no way to tell
 * which shade was selected. That is the bug this addresses.
 *
 * The ring cannot simply move outward on its own, because on a light page it
 * would then be a near-black ring sitting a hairline away from a near-black disc,
 * and the two would read as one blob. What has to change is the ground the ring
 * is drawn on, so:
 *
 * - **Dark page: unchanged.** Glass fills the swatch, LED at [DARK_SWATCH_LED],
 *   ring inset at the rim. `#EFF0F7` on `#0E0E0E` is 17.0:1.
 * - **Light page:** the swatch's outer disc is `Color.White` with a hairline in
 *   `colorScheme.outline` (2.8:1 against the `#F2F2FA` background, which is all a
 *   1 dp boundary needs), and the glass shrinks to [LIGHT_SWATCH_GLASS] inside
 *   it. The ring is then near-black on white: **17.9:1**, and unmistakable.
 *
 * **The trap in "make the surround white", and why the glass survives.** The LED
 * is white at the level's own alpha, so it is not only the 100 % swatch that
 * would vanish on a white surround — 50 % white over white is white, and so is
 * 10 %. All three would disappear, not one. Keeping a black glass under the LED
 * is what makes the shades legible on a light page at all, and it keeps the
 * swatch *true*: you still pick a white dot and still paint a white pixel, which
 * an inked-in swatch (dark dot = bright LED) would have quietly inverted. The
 * three levels measure 1.3:1, 5.3:1 and 19.3:1 against the glass in both themes —
 * unlit, mid and full, in that order, and the unlit one is meant to be faint
 * because that is what an unlit LED looks like.

     *   canvas shows the new art immediately and the timeline is the new
     *   timeline. A variant the user is *not* looking at needs nothing done to
     *   it: it is already in [design] and [loadFrames] will find it on the next
     *   switch, which is precisely how [addVariant] already works.
     * - **A `kind` change lands for free.** The timeline and onion skin are
     *   composed from `design.kind`, so an animation appearing or disappearing
     *   mid-session is a recomposition rather than a special case.
     * - **A `levels` change re-clamps the brush.** `cells` are palette *indices*;
     *   a document that arrives with a two-entry palette while the brush points
     *   at swatch three would leave a selection with no swatch under it and a
     *   brush that paints index 2 into a palette that has none.
     * - **Per-frame undo histories are dropped**, exactly as [switchTo] drops them
     *   and for the same reason: their snapshots are arrays of the old geometry
     *   and the old palette.
     *
     * ## Whether the user can undo it, and who decides
     *
     * [recordUndo] is that decision, and it belongs to the caller because the two
     * callers answer it differently:
     *
     *  - **A tool in the editor passes true.** The document this replaced goes on
     *    [documentUndo] and the tool row's undo arrow lights up, because a user
     *    who has just pressed a button in the editor has exactly one idea of how
     *    to take it back and it is that arrow. See [undo] for what a press does.
     *  - **The assistant passes false** (the default), and keeps holding the
     *    `Design` this returns for its own revert banner. That is a *narrower*
     *    affordance, not a missing one: a chat turn can rewrite the whole document
     *    including the other panel, so the way back is offered beside the message
     *    that caused it, where it can be labelled with what it reverts. Two
     *    controls for the same step would be two chances to press the wrong one.
     *
     * A `false` replacement also **clears both document stacks**, which is the
     * same rule [switchTo] follows: a step from before a wholesale change nobody
     * else knows about would restore a document that never had that change in it.
     *
     * ## What the model may not change
     *
     * Identity. `id` names the file, `author` and `createdAt` describe a person
     * and a moment, and `format`/`formatVersion` are the app's to declare — all
     * are pinned from the current design here, on top of `GlyphAiTools` already
     * merging onto it, so neither layer alone is load-bearing. `modifiedAt` is
     * restamped, because the design genuinely just changed.
     *
     * Returns null and changes nothing if [incoming] carries no artwork at all,
     * which no validated document does — the check is here so that "the editor
     * refused" is a state the caller can report to the model rather than a
     * blank canvas nobody explains.
