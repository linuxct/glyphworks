/**
 * Nothing-styled theme, MONOCHROME with three enumerated exceptions: black, white
 * and grays everywhere, and **almost no hue in anything that carries meaning** —
 * state, selection, errors and emphasis are contrast (full-strength ink vs muted
 * grays), never colour. Nothing's own headline typeface is used for page titles.
 *
 * The three exceptions are named, bounded, and are the whole list:
 *
 * 1. **The Create tab's `+` FAB**, painted in Nothing's brand red and blue — the
 *    one place the product signs its name. See [NothingLiquidRed] and
 *    `ui/LiquidFab.kt`.
 * 2. **The recording dot** on the device illustration
 *    (`ui/design/GlyphCanvas.kt`'s `RECORDING_DOT_COLOR`), which is not an accent
 *    at all but a picture of a red square that exists on the back of the phone.
 * 3. **The setup-attention badge** on the navigation bar's Settings chip
 *    ([NavPillColors.badgeContainer], drawn by `MainActivity`'s `AttentionBadge`)
 *    — a 16 dp red disc with a white `!` in it, shown only while the Initial
 *    setup checklist has an outstanding item. Requested explicitly, and the only
 *    one of the three where hue does carry meaning. It is bounded by being tiny,
 *    by being conditional, and by the mark: the `!` is what says "attention", so
 *    the badge still works read out by TalkBack, in greyscale, and to a
 *    colour-blind user. Colour is never the only signal.
 *
 * None of the three is a palette. There is no accent role in either scheme below,
 * nothing else may borrow those colours, and a fourth exception is a change to
 * this rule rather than an application of it.
 *
 * Both schemes mirror Nothing OS Settings: a light lavender-gray page with
 * white cards, and a pure-black page with #191C20 cards in dark mode (values
 * sampled from the device).
 *
 * The headline font (NType82-Regular) is loaded AT RUNTIME from the
 * firmware's font directories (the app runs on a Nothing phone, so the exact
 * settings-title font is already on disk — no need to redistribute it). Falls
 * back to the system serif family when no Nothing font is found; the chosen
 * file is logged under the "Theme" component.
